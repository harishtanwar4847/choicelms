            below. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to

            Before we dig into this, let’s tell you our trust story. When we
            started our noble journey in 2017, we wanted to make it possible for
            everyone to access legitimate investments, and we did that.
          </p>
          <p>
            We didn’t stop at making it possible for people to access these
            investment opportunities with just NGN100, we introduced an improved
            security structure to the fintech space. We did this by setting up a
            trust structure in partnership with Meristem Trustees; we’ll explain
            the importance of this here.
          </p>

            such requests, our commitment is to manage your money for steady
            growth and not make false promises that get you excited. Three years
            on, that hasn’t changed.
