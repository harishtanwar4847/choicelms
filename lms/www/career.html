                    <p>
                      Before we dig into this, let’s tell you our trust story.
                      When we started our noble journey in 2017, we wanted to
                      make it possible for everyone to access legitimate
                      investments, and we did that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We didn’t stop at making it possible for people to access
                      these investment opportunities with just NGN100, we
                      introduced an improved security structure to the fintech
                      space. We did this by setting up a trust structure in
                      partnership with Meristem Trustees; we’ll explain the
                      importance of this here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Right from our very first user, trust has always been our
                      currency. Many have come to us with expectations that are
                      impossible to achieve - 10% monthly for instance. We’ve
                      always been clear about such requests, our commitment is
                      to manage your money for steady growth and not make false
                      promises that get you excited. Three years on, that hasn’t
                      changed.
