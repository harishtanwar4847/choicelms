                established traditional accounting practice which he had
                inherited from his father. He is the man who conceptualized the
                idea for this venture and is extremely passionate for the same.

              <p>
                Ratiraj is leading his team from the front and leaves no stone
                unturned in order to ensure the success of this venture. Having
                spent 20 years in the industry he has deep understanding of the
                business and creates the right support plank which will help the
                venture move forward.
